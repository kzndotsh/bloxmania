## URL Generation

The section automatically generates collection URLs based on game names:

1. **Custom Link**: If a custom URL is provided in the "Game Link" field, it will be used
2. **Auto-Generated**: If no custom link is provided, the system generates a URL using the game name:
   - "Grow A Garden" â†’ `/collections/grow-a-garden`
   - "Fortnite" â†’ `/collections/fortnite`
   - "Pet Simulator 99" â†’ `/collections/pet-simulator-99`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Game Card
```liquid
{% comment %} This will create a clickable card for "Grow A Garden" {% endcomment %}
{% render 'supported-games' %}
```

### Custom Collection Link
```liquid
{% comment %} In the theme editor, set Game Link to "/collections/custom-grow-garden" {% endcomment %}
```

### Coming Soon Game
```liquid
{% comment %} In the theme editor, check "Mark as Coming Soon" {% endcomment %}
```

## Fallback Content

If no game blocks are configured in the theme editor, the section displays three default games:

1. **Grow A Garden** â†’ `/collections/grow-a-garden`
2. **Fortnite** â†’ `/collections/fortnite`
3. **Pet Simulator 99** â†’ `/collections/pet-simulator-99`

All fallback games are marked as "Coming Soon" with overlay effects.
