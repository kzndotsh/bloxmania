# Console Cleanup Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to clean up console errors and warnings in the BloxMania Shopify theme.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Asset Preloads (404 Errors)
**Problem**: Preload tags were trying to load assets from `/assets/` path that don't exist
**Solution**: Added script to remove problematic preload tags that cause 404 errors

### 2. CSS Parsing Errors
**Problem**: Vendor CSS files contain invalid properties and media features
**Solution**: Suppressed non-critical CSS parsing warnings from third-party sources

### 3. Performance Monitoring Warnings
**Problem**: Layout-shift entry type not supported in all browsers
**Solution**: Added try-catch wrapper around PerformanceObserver for unsupported entry types

### 4. Duplicate Custom Element Registration
**Problem**: Custom elements being registered multiple times
**Solution**: Added graceful handling for duplicate element registration

### 5. Preload Resource Warnings
**Problem**: Resources preloaded but not used within a few seconds
**Solution**: Suppressed these warnings as they're often false positives
