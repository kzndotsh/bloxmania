# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive cleanup and modernization of the BloxMania Shopify theme directory. The theme currently has several issues including leftover/unused code, inconsistent Tailwind CSS usage, outdated CSS practices, poor responsive design patterns, large monolithic functions, and violations of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. The goal is to create a clean, modern, maintainable, and performant theme codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the theme, I want all unused and leftover code removed, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify and remove all unused CSS classes, JavaScript functions, and assets
2. WHEN examining CSS files THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate Tailwind utility classes and redundant custom CSS
3. WHEN reviewing JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL eliminate dead code and unused event listeners
4. WHEN checking assets THEN the system SHALL remove unused image files and scripts
5. WHEN validating Liquid templates THEN the system SHALL remove commented-out code and unused template variables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all styling to use Tailwind CSS consistently, so that the design system is unified and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing custom CSS THEN the system SHALL convert all custom styles to Tailwind utility classes where possible
2. WHEN examining inline styles THEN the system SHALL replace them with appropriate Tailwind classes
3. WHEN analyzing component styles THEN the system SHALL create reusable Tailwind component classes for repeated patterns
4. WHEN checking for CSS-in-JS THEN the system SHALL migrate to Tailwind classes in templates
5. WHEN validating the design system THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent use of Tailwind's color palette, spacing, and typography scales

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS to follow modern best practices, so that the code is performant and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing CSS architecture THEN the system SHALL implement proper CSS custom properties for theme variables
2. WHEN reviewing CSS organization THEN the system SHALL structure styles using logical layers (base, components, utilities)
3. WHEN examining animations THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms and will-change properties for optimal performance
4. WHEN checking accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure proper focus states, color contrast, and screen reader support
5. WHEN validating browser support THEN the system SHALL use modern CSS features with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the theme to be fully responsive and accessible, so that I have an optimal experience regardless of screen size or assistive technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide optimized layouts using mobile-first responsive design
2. WHEN testing across breakpoints THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth transitions and appropriate content scaling
3. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide adequate touch targets (minimum 44px)
4. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
5. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and alternative text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining JavaScript code, I want functions broken down into smaller, focused units, so that the code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing JavaScript functions THEN the system SHALL identify functions longer than 20 lines for refactoring
2. WHEN reviewing function complexity THEN the system SHALL break down functions with multiple responsibilities into single-purpose functions
3. WHEN examining event handlers THEN the system SHALL extract complex logic into separate utility functions
4. WHEN checking code organization THEN the system SHALL group related functions into logical modules or classes
5. WHEN validating function signatures THEN the system SHALL ensure functions have clear, descriptive names and minimal parameters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate code duplication, so that the codebase follows DRY principles and is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for duplicate code THEN the system SHALL identify and consolidate repeated CSS patterns into reusable components
2. WHEN reviewing JavaScript THEN the system SHALL extract common functionality into utility functions or modules
3. WHEN examining Liquid templates THEN the system SHALL create reusable snippets for repeated markup patterns
4. WHEN analyzing configuration THEN the system SHALL centralize theme settings and constants
5. WHEN checking styling patterns THEN the system SHALL create consistent design tokens and component variants

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code organization and structure, so that the codebase is scalable and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL implement a logical directory structure with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN structuring CSS THEN the system SHALL use a consistent methodology (BEM-like naming for custom components)
3. WHEN organizing JavaScript THEN the system SHALL implement proper module patterns and dependency management
4. WHEN structuring templates THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent naming conventions and file organization
5. WHEN documenting code THEN the system SHALL provide clear comments and documentation for complex logic

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want fast loading times and smooth interactions, so that I have an excellent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the site THEN the system SHALL minimize CSS and JavaScript bundle sizes
2. WHEN rendering pages THEN the system SHALL implement efficient lazy loading for images and non-critical resources
3. WHEN interacting with elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations using CSS transforms and GPU acceleration
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL achieve improved Core Web Vitals scores
5. WHEN analyzing network requests THEN the system SHALL minimize the number of HTTP requests and optimize asset delivery
