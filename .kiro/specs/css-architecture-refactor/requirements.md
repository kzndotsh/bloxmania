# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BloxMania theme's CSS architecture has become unmaintainable due to years of refactoring, duplications, and ad-hoc fixes. The current styles.css file is nearly 10,000 lines with massive duplication, conflicting rules, and overwrites that are causing critical issues like mobile menu conflicts. This project will establish a clean, maintainable CSS architecture following Dawn theme patterns and modern best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean CSS architecture with separated concerns, so that I can maintain and extend the theme without conflicts or duplications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CSS refactor is complete THEN the system SHALL have separate CSS files for different concerns (base, components, utilities, layout)
2. WHEN examining the CSS files THEN the system SHALL have zero duplicate CSS rules or keyframe animations
3. WHEN building the CSS THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and prevent duplicate rules through PostCSS plugins
4. WHEN a developer adds new CSS THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines on which file to modify
5. IF a CSS rule exists in multiple files THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into the appropriate single location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mobile menu functionality to work correctly, so that users can navigate the site on mobile devices without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile menu is opened THEN the system SHALL hide desktop navigation elements without conflicts
2. WHEN the mobile menu is closed THEN the system SHALL restore desktop navigation without visual glitches
3. WHEN examining mobile menu CSS THEN the system SHALL have no duplicate or conflicting z-index rules
4. WHEN the mobile menu is active THEN the system SHALL prevent body scrolling and overlay content properly
5. IF mobile menu styles conflict with header styles THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts through proper CSS architecture

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS custom properties and design tokens centralized, so that theme customization is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS custom properties are defined THEN the system SHALL centralize them in a single design tokens file
2. WHEN colors, spacing, or typography values are used THEN the system SHALL reference centralized custom properties
3. WHEN theme settings change THEN the system SHALL update CSS through custom properties without code changes
4. WHEN examining CSS files THEN the system SHALL have no hardcoded color or spacing values outside of design tokens
5. IF a design token is needed THEN the system SHALL provide it through CSS custom properties

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component-based CSS architecture, so that styles are modular and reusable across the theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS components are created THEN the system SHALL follow Dawn theme naming conventions (component-*.css)
2. WHEN a component is styled THEN the system SHALL encapsulate all related styles in a single component file
3. WHEN components are imported THEN the system SHALL maintain proper dependency order and avoid conflicts
4. WHEN examining component CSS THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between component styles and utilities
5. IF a style affects multiple components THEN the system SHALL place it in the appropriate shared location

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Tailwind CSS integration without conflicts, so that utility classes work alongside custom components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwind utilities are used THEN the system SHALL not conflict with custom component styles
2. WHEN custom components are created THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's @layer directive for proper cascade order
3. WHEN building CSS THEN the system SHALL purge unused Tailwind classes in production
4. WHEN examining CSS output THEN the system SHALL have proper layer ordering (base, components, utilities)
5. IF Tailwind utilities conflict with custom styles THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts through proper layering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-optimized CSS output, so that the theme loads quickly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is built for production THEN the system SHALL minify and optimize the output
2. WHEN duplicate rules exist THEN the system SHALL automatically remove them during build
3. WHEN CSS is served THEN the system SHALL have minimal file size without sacrificing functionality
4. WHEN examining build output THEN the system SHALL have no unused CSS rules in production
5. IF CSS contains redundant rules THEN the system SHALL consolidate them automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear CSS file organization, so that I can quickly locate and modify styles for specific features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for base styles THEN the system SHALL provide them in a dedicated base.css file
2. WHEN looking for component styles THEN the system SHALL organize them in separate component-*.css files
3. WHEN looking for utility styles THEN the system SHALL provide them in a dedicated utilities.css file
4. WHEN looking for layout styles THEN the system SHALL provide them in a dedicated layout.css file
5. IF a developer needs to modify styles THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on file organization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS build process integration, so that the new architecture works seamlessly with existing build tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is built THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing Tailwind and PostCSS configuration
2. WHEN development mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide fast rebuilds and hot reloading
3. WHEN production builds run THEN the system SHALL optimize and minify CSS automatically
4. WHEN examining build output THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with Shopify theme requirements
5. IF build processes change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing npm scripts
